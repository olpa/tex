CALS tables

The "cals" package is a set of macros to typeset multipage tables
with repeatable headers and footers, with cells spanned over
rows and columns. Decorations are supported: padding, background
color, width of separation rules. The code is compatible with
multicols and bidi.

The work is released to public (LaTeX license, see below)
by bitplant.de GmbH, a company which provides technical
documentation services to industry.
