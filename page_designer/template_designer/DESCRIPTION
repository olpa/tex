Template-Designer is a utility to create template definitions 
which are ready to convert to XSL-FO or TeXML

olpa notes.

Design of the program:

Main frame is extended by function from helper classes.

The information panel isn't re-used. Each time user selects a new branch in the tree, the new panel is created and the old one is deleted.

With each item in the tree, a corresponding XML chunk is associated. Information panels are filled in from this XML, and this XML is updated when leaving the panel.

Also, for some reason, the global dictionary tempItemData is used. This might be a source for bugs, and actually I had to fix one (see svn logs for 03.06.2010 and 04.06.2010).
